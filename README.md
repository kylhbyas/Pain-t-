# Pain(t)

This is a rough paint application. It lets you paint on a canvas like the artist you are. It also sets a custom main object as the entry point to the program.


# Program usage
How do we run your program?
* To run the program:
  * Open the program in visual studio and hit the play button
* Does it expect any inputs?
  * A message box will appear, saying hello from the new main. Click ok.
  The program will react on mouse click. Click and drag to create a line.

# Notes
* What is working?
  * The program is believed to be working as intended.
* What are the limitations of the program?
  * Limited by my imagination
  * The colors could be done via RGB sliders instead of preselected buttons.
  
* What design decisions did you make?
  * The drawing pen diameter is actually a square where height is the same as the width.
